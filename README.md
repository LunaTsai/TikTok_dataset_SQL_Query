# TikTok Account Attribute Dataset for Fake Account Detection

## Project Overview

To support TikTok fake account detection using machine learning, our research team at McGill University developed a benchmarking dataset based on TikTok account data. I applied advanced SQL techniques to extract, join, and transform data across multiple relational tables. This project demonstrates my ability to write complex SQL queries and support data-driven research workflows.

## Sector

This project was developed for the public sector, specifically in an academic research context at McGill University.

## Project Size

Estimated value: Less than $100,000.  
Scope: Non-commercial academic dataset creation for machine learning research.

## Approach

### Design and Development

- Collected TikTok data using Python and official/public APIs.
- Stored and structured the data in MySQL.
- Created a benchmark dataset using complex SQL logic, including:
  - Multi-table joins
  - Aggregations and conditional logic (CASE)
  - Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
  - Time-based and user-based feature engineering

### Quality Assurance

- Manually verified sample records for correctness
- Checked data consistency across tables
- Removed duplicate entries to ensure clean final outputs

### Communication

- Regularly shared progress with the research team
- Discussed data schema and feature requirements with collaborators
- Ensured alignment with the goals of the fake account detection model

## Skills and Technologies

### Skills

- SQL (advanced joins, aggregation, filtering)
- Data transformation and cleaning
- API usage and error handling
- Feature engineering for machine learning

### Tools and Technologies

- Python (for data scraping and automation)
- TikTok APIs (to extract user, comment, and post metadata)
- MySQL (for data storage and querying)
